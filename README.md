# PYTHON---NUMPY-PROJECT
Here's a detailed explanation of the code logic, data preprocessing steps, model selection, evaluation procedures, running instructions, and optional report documentation:

### Code Logic:
1. **Data Collection**: The program collects historical stock price data from a reliable source or API, obtaining features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing steps are performed to clean the data and prepare it for model training. This includes handling missing or invalid values and normalizing or scaling the data if required.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features are engineered to enhance the predictive power of the model. This could involve creating moving averages, technical indicators, or other relevant features from the raw data.

4. **Model Selection**: The program selects an appropriate machine learning model for stock price prediction. Common choices include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.

5. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained using the preprocessed data. The dataset is typically split into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

6. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

7. **Prediction and Visualization**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to make predictions on future stock prices. Visualizations are created to compare the predicted prices with actual historical prices, providing insights into the model's accuracy and performance.

### Data Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Any missing values in the dataset are addressed. This could involve imputation (replacing missing values with the mean or median) or dropping rows or columns with missing values.

2. **Normalization/Scaling**: If necessary, the data is scaled or normalized to bring all features to a similar scale. This is important for models like linear regression that are sensitive to the scale of the input features.

### Model Selection and Evaluation Procedures:
1. **Choosing Model**: The program selects a suitable machine learning model for stock price prediction based on factors such as complexity, interpretability, and performance on similar datasets.

2. **Training and Testing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, typically using a ratio such as 80:20 or 70:30. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

3. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained using the training data. During training, the model learns the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks. This metric quantifies the difference between predicted and actual values.

### Running the Script:
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries - pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. You can install these libraries using pip: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`.

2. **Prepare Input Data**: Obtain historical stock price data in a suitable format, such as a CSV file.

3. **Set Parameters**: Adjust parameters such as the API key, stock symbol, start date, and end date as needed in the script.

4. **Run the Script**: Execute the script using a Python interpreter: `python stock_price_prediction.py`.

5. **Interpret Results**: Review the model's performance metrics (e.g., mean squared error) and visualizations of predicted vs. actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy and performance.

### Optional Report Documentation:
A report summarizing the stock price prediction process, model performance, and insights gained could include:
- Overview of the dataset and features used for prediction.
- Description of preprocessing steps and feature engineering techniques.
- Selection of machine learning models and rationale behind the choice.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Insights gained from analyzing predicted vs. actual stock prices.
- Recommendations for further analysis or improvements to the predictive model.

By following these instructions, users can run the script, understand the stock price prediction process, evaluate model performance, and potentially gain insights into future stock price movements. Optionally, report documentation can provide a comprehensive summary of the analysis findings and their implications.
